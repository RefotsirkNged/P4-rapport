\subsection{Small step semantics and big step semantics}
Operational semantics can be defined with small step semantics and big step semantics. Big step semantics define a single transition from the starting point of \(\gamma{}\) to the end state of \(\gamma{}'\), whereas in the small step semantics the state \(\gamma'\). The transitions are shown with an arrow \(\rightarrow{}\!\!\) in big step semantics and a double lined right arrow \(\Rightarrow\) in small step semantics. Big step semantics are in most cases able to define the semantics, but when describing parallelism or non-determinism, big step semantics are not able to define the semantics correctly, whereas small step semantics can. Big step semantics are easier to formulate, making them the preferred choice when defining semantics in this report, since \lang{} does not contain non-determinism, ruling out the advantages of small step semantics.
