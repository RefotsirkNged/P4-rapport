\chapter{Semantics}\label{chap:semantics}
Semantics is the meaning of a language and the pragmatic of it. It covers the internal behavior of the running programs, when referring to computer science.

The semantics are defined in different ways. The most common ways are denotational, operational and axiomatic semantics. This report uses the operational semantics to define how the semantics works for the language \lang{}.

This concludes the semantics chapter, where the abstract syntax was presented, the operational semantics were specified and where it was explained how the type rules and scope rules of \lang{} work. 
Now that all the semantics of \lang{} have been formally specified, a description of the implementation of \lang{} will follow.
