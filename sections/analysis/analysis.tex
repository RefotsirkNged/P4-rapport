\chapter{Preliminary analysis}


This chapter will analyse existing tools and programming languages that can be used to introduce young people to programming, as well as the fundamentals of game development, to better understand how to design a new programming language that can assist in introducing and engage young people to programming and computer science in general. At the end of this chapter, a problem statement will be defined as a basis for the language that will be designed later in this report.
